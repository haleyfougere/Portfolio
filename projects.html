                                gourmet bagel shop, showcases a blend of creative and technical prowess, developed using
                                C# with .NET and Entity Framework, and hosted on Azure for robust scalability. It
                                features a unique bagel customization tool, enhancing user engagement through
                                interactive design, and a seamless checkout process. Overcoming challenges such as
                                optimizing for mobile responsiveness, I refined my skills in cloud integration, secure
                                payment processing, and responsive UI design. This work not only demonstrates a
                                significant leap in my software development journey but also aligns with my career goal
                                of crafting user-centered applications that leverage cloud technology, marking a pivotal
                                advancement towards becoming a full-stack developer specialized in cloud-based

                                with a simple yet profound challenge: fill the board without aligning three markers in a
                                row. Developed in JavaScript, this game tests strategic foresight and spatial awareness,
                                inviting players into an elegantly designed, interactive experience. Crafting this
                                project honed my JavaScript skills, particularly in DOM manipulation and responsive UI
                                creation, while embedding a deeper appreciation for game design's nuanced balance
                                between simplicity and complexity. It stands as a testament to my ability to transform
                                basic concepts into compelling digital experiences, underlining my passion for
                                developing engaging, thought-provoking content.

                                in C++ that leverages the power of stacks to navigate through complex mazes. By
                                interpreting maze files, the program dynamically determines the path from start to
                                finish, showcasing the algorithm's efficiency and the stack data structure's
                                effectiveness in managing spatial data. This project not only highlights my adeptness
                                with C++ and advanced data structures but also reflects my analytical skills in devising
                                and implementing algorithms to tackle intricate problems. It serves as a notable example
                                of my capacity to apply theoretical computer science concepts to develop practical,
                                real-world solutions, demonstrating a significant stride in my programming journey and
